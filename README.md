POOL is an arcade first-person arena shooter inspired by Doom, Quake, and a particular cue sport.
Either you knock the balls into the pockets, or the balls knock *you* into a pocket.

It was made for [One Script Games](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/osg-jam.6018/) jam.

## Controls:

* WASD, Space: Movement
* Left mouse button (hold): Charge and attack
* F5/F6/F7/F8: Change antialiasing (if supported)
* Alt+Enter: Fullscreen (recommended)

## Caveats

Lacks an OSX build due to discovering several bugs ([1](http://bugs.yoyogames.com/view.php?id=23698), [2](http://bugs.yoyogames.com/view.php?id=23702)).

Importing to GameMaker Studio 2 may alleviate the bugs, but you'll have to fix issues with compatibility scripts first.
